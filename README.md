# CatLaser

This is a simple ardunio project built for the Feather M0 adafruit board.  A laser track may be recorded while a button is held.  This laser track will then be replayed on a loop.

It uses my fusion library (https://github.com/carrino/LSM9DS0_Fusion) built for the the 9dof board from adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/products/2021
